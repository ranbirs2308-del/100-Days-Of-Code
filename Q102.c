//Write a Program to take a sorted array arr[] and an integer x as input, find the index (0-based) of the smallest element in arr[] that is greater than or equal to x and print it. This element is called the ceil of x. If such an element does not exist, print -1. Note: In case of multiple occurrences of ceil of x, return the index of the first occurrence.
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a[100], n, x, i;
    int answer = -1;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        scanf("%d", &a[i]);
    }
    scanf("%d", &x);
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        if (a[i] >= x)
        {
            answer = i;
            break;
        }
    }
    printf("%d", answer);
